# coursera-cleaning-data
Course project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" from Coursera

## Files

tidy\_data.txt -- The complete new summary data set in text format.

run\_analysis.R -- The data cleaning script used to produce that summary data set.

CodeBook.md -- Overview of the data and variables used by this project.

## Requirements

The script requires **dplyr** and **read.table** packages. Both packages can be downloaded from CRAN.

Source data must be downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.), unpacked and placed in the current working directory before running the script. The script expects "UCI HAR Dataset" folder to be present in the current working directory.
